# AI Meeting Assistant Requirements

## Project Goal
Build an AI-powered web application that summarizes online meetings and generates structured notes, including key discussion points, decisions, action items, and conclusions.

## Functional Requirements
- Accept audio, video, or text inputs from online meetings (e.g., Zoom, Teams).
- Convert audio/video to text using a transcription API (e.g., AssemblyAI).
- Summarize transcripts and extract key points, decisions, and action items using NLP (e.g., Hugging Face).
- Store meeting metadata, transcripts, and summaries in a database (e.g., Firebase).
- Display results in a structured, user-friendly format with sections for summary, discussion points, decisions, action items, and conclusion.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Ensure compatibility with common meeting platforms (Zoom, Microsoft Teams).
- Maintain a professional, neutral tone in summaries.
- Handle meetings of varying lengths (5 minutes to 2 hours).
- Ensure the web app is responsive for desktop and mobile users.

## Constraints
- Complete the project within 2 weeks (by June 13, 2025).
- Avoid processing sensitive or irrelevant information unless explicitly relevant.
- Use affordable/free APIs and tools to stay within budget.

## Deliverables
- A web application with upload and display functionality.
- Backend APIs for transcription, summarization, and data storage.
- User documentation for using the application.
