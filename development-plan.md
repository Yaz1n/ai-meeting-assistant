# AI Meeting Assistant Development Plan

## Week 1: Core Development
### Day 3-4: Backend Development (Transcription and Data Processing)
- Integrate AssemblyAI API for audio-to-text transcription.
- Create `/transcribe` endpoint to accept audio/video files and return transcripts.
- Set up Python scripts for summarization and entity extraction using Hugging Face `transformers`.
- Create `/summarize` endpoint to process transcripts and generate structured notes.
- Test transcription and summarization with sample data.

### Day 5-6: Frontend Development
- Build React components for file upload (`UploadComponent`), summary display (`SummaryComponent`), and past meetings (`MeetingListComponent`).
- Style components with plain CSS for responsiveness.
- Connect frontend to backend APIs using Axios.
- Test UI with sample data.

### Day 7: Database Integration and Testing
- Integrate Firebase for storing meeting metadata, transcripts, and summaries.
- Create endpoints for saving/retrieving data (`/save`, `/meetings`).
- Test end-to-end flow (upload, transcribe, summarize, store, display).

## Week 2: Refinement, Testing, and Deployment
### Day 8-9: NLP Model Tuning and Output Formatting
- Fine-tune Hugging Face model (e.g., BART) for meeting-specific summarization.
- Implement logic to structure output (summary, discussion points, decisions, action items, conclusion).
- Add error handling for poor audio or incomplete transcripts.

### Day 10-11: Integration and End-to-End Testing
- Ensure seamless frontend-backend integration.
- Test with various meeting formats (short/long, Zoom/Teams).
- Validate output accuracy and UI responsiveness.

### Day 12-13: UI/UX Polish and Final Testing
- Refine UI (loading states, error messages, responsiveness).
- Conduct user acceptance testing with sample users.
- Fix bugs and optimize performance.

### Day 14: Deployment and Documentation
- Deploy frontend and backend to Vercel.
- Write user and developer documentation.
- Perform final testing on the deployed app.
